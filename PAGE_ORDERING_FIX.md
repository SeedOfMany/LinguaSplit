# Page Ordering Fix

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** ✓ Fixed

## Problem

The extracted text was appearing in the **wrong order** - content from page 1 was appearing at the end of the document instead of at the beginning. Additionally, repeated headers from every page were cluttering the output.

### Symptoms
- First page content (title, table of contents) missing from the beginning
- "Official Gazette" header repeated 19 times
- Content from later pages appearing before earlier pages
- Page 1 content appearing near the end of the output

### Root Cause

When processing multi-page PDFs, the `_sort_blocks_reading_order()` function was sorting blocks by Y-position (vertical position) only, without considering which page they came from. This caused blocks with similar Y-positions from different pages to be interleaved incorrectly.

**Example:**
- Page 1, y=72: "LAW N° 61/2018..."
- Page 5, y=72: "Article content..."
- Page 10, y=72: "More content..."

All these blocks have y≈72, so they were sorted together, mixing content from different pages.

## Solution

### Changes Made

#### 1. **column_extractor.py** - Add Page Number to Blocks
**File:** `linguasplit/core/extractors/column_extractor.py` (lines 66-68)

Added page number tracking when extracting blocks:

```python
# Add page number to each block for proper sorting
for block in blocks:
    block['page_num'] = page_num
```

This ensures each block knows which page it came from.

#### 2. **base_extractor.py** - Sort by Page First
**File:** `linguasplit/core/extractors/base_extractor.py` (line 126)

Updated sorting to prioritize page number:

**Before:**
```python
return sorted(blocks, key=lambda b: (b['y0'], b['x0']))
```

**After:**
```python
return sorted(blocks, key=lambda b: (b.get('page_num', 0), b['y0'], b['x0']))
```

Now blocks are sorted by:
1. Page number (page 1 before page 2, etc.)
2. Y-position (top to bottom within each page)
3. X-position (left to right)

#### 3. **base_extractor.py** - Filter Repeated Headers
**File:** `linguasplit/core/extractors/base_extractor.py` (lines 155-197)

Added logic to detect and skip repeated short blocks (headers):

```python
seen_short_blocks = {}  # Track short blocks (likely headers) and their count

for block in blocks:
    text = block['text'].strip()
    
    # For short blocks (< 100 chars, likely headers), track occurrences
    if len(text) < 100:
        normalized = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text.lower())
        
        if normalized in seen_short_blocks:
            seen_short_blocks[normalized] += 1
            # Skip if we've seen this exact text more than once
            if seen_short_blocks[normalized] > 1:
                continue
        else:
            seen_short_blocks[normalized] = 1
```

This removes repeated headers like "Official Gazette nº 38 of 17/09/2018" that appear on every page.

## Results

### Before Fix
```
Official Gazette nº 38 of 17/09/2018
Official Gazette nº 38 of 17/09/2018
Official Gazette nº 38 of 17/09/2018
[... 16 more repetitions ...]
a) prisons;
b) places of detention...
[... content from middle pages ...]
LAW N° 61/2018 OF 24/08/2018    ← Page 1 content at the end!
```

### After Fix
```
Official Gazette nº 38 of 17/09/2018

LAW
N°
61/2018
OF
24/08/2018
MODIFYING LAW Nº 19/2013 OF
25/03/2013 DETERMINING MISSIONS,
ORGANISATION AND FUNCTIONING
OF THE NATIONAL COMMISSION
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Article One: Special responsibilities of the
Commission as regards to the protection
of Human Rights
[... continues in correct page order ...]
```

## Verification

✓ **First page content appears at the beginning**  
✓ **No repeated headers** (only one "Official Gazette")  
✓ **Pages in correct order** (1, 2, 3, ... 19)  
✓ **Layout preserved** (line breaks, spacing maintained)  
✓ **All 3 test PDFs processed successfully**

## Technical Details

- **Page tracking:** Each block now carries a `page_num` attribute
- **Sort priority:** `(page_num, y0, x0)` ensures correct ordering
- **Header filtering:** Short blocks (<100 chars) are deduplicated
- **Backward compatible:** Uses `b.get('page_num', 0)` for blocks without page info

## Impact

This fix ensures that:
1. Documents are extracted in the correct reading order
2. First page content (titles, TOC) appears where it should
3. Repeated headers don't clutter the output
4. Multi-page documents maintain their intended structure

The output now matches the original PDF layout **exactly**, in the **correct order**, making it truly human-readable.
