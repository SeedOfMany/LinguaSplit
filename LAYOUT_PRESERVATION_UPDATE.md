# Layout Preservation Update

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** ✓ Successfully Implemented

## Summary

The LinguaSplit application has been updated to preserve the exact original layout of PDF documents, including line breaks, spacing, and formatting as intended by the original document creators.

## Problem

Previously, the application was reformatting the extracted text by:
- Merging list items onto single lines (e.g., "a) prisons; b) places..." all together)
- Joining lines that didn't end with punctuation
- Adding markdown formatting (headings, bullet points, extra spacing)
- Restructuring paragraphs and sections

This made the output harder to read compared to the original PDF layout.

## Solution

### Changes Made

#### 1. **base_extractor.py** - Preserved Line Breaks in Block Extraction
**File:** `linguasplit/core/extractors/base_extractor.py`

**Changed:** `_extract_text_blocks()` method (lines 67-111)
- Now extracts each line within a block as a separate line
- Changed from joining all spans with spaces to joining lines with `\n`
- Preserves the PDF's internal line structure exactly

**Before:**
```python
text = " ".join(text_parts).strip()  # Merged all text
```

**After:**
```python
# Extract text from lines - PRESERVE line breaks!
line_texts = []
for line in block.get("lines", []):
    span_texts = []
    for span in line.get("spans", []):
        span_texts.append(span.get("text", ""))
    line_text = "".join(span_texts).strip()
    if line_text:
        line_texts.append(line_text)

# Join lines with newline to preserve PDF structure
text = "\n".join(line_texts)
```

**Changed:** `_combine_text_blocks()` method (lines 149-174)
- Simplified to just concatenate blocks with separator
- Removed all pattern matching and paragraph splitting logic
- Preserves original text structure

**Changed:** `_clean_text()` method (lines 176-210)
- Only removes excessive spaces within lines
- Keeps all line breaks intact
- Preserves empty lines for vertical spacing

#### 2. **markdown_formatter.py** - Disabled Formatting Enhancements
**File:** `linguasplit/formatters/markdown_formatter.py`

**Changed:** `_format_content()` method (lines 120-134)
- Simplified to return text as-is
- Removed heading detection and formatting
- Removed list item detection and formatting
- Removed extra spacing logic

**Before:**
```python
# Complex logic to detect headings, format lists, add spacing...
formatted_lines.append(f"{'#' * heading_level} {line_stripped}")
```

**After:**
```python
def _format_content(self, text: str, page_breaks: Optional[List[int]] = None) -> str:
    # Just return the text as-is with original line breaks
    # No heading detection, no list formatting, no extra spacing
    return text
```

#### 3. **text_cleaner.py** - Disabled Line Joining
**File:** `linguasplit/formatters/text_cleaner.py`

**Changed:** `fix_line_breaks()` method (lines 82-102)
- Removed line joining logic that merged lines without punctuation
- Only keeps hyphenated word fixing (words broken across lines)

**Before:**
```python
# Join lines that are part of the same sentence
text = re.sub(r'(?<![.!?:])\n(?=[a-z])', ' ', text)
```

**After:**
```python
# Only fix hyphenated words at line end
text = re.sub(r'-\n(\w)', r'\1', text)
# DO NOT join lines - preserve PDF layout exactly as-is
```

## Verification Results

### Test Files Processed
- **385 KB.pdf** → 3 files (english, french, kinyarwanda)
- **476 KB.pdf** → 3 files (english, french, kinyarwanda)
- **584 KB.pdf** → 3 files (english, french, kinyarwanda)

**Total:** 9 files (exactly 3 per PDF, no duplicates)

### Layout Preservation Verified

✓ **List Items:** Each item (a), b), c)...) on separate lines
```
a)
prisons;
b)
places of detention investigation
measures;
c)
rehabilitation and transit centres;
```

✓ **Numbered Items:** Each item (1°, 2°, 3°...) on separate lines
```
1°
civil society including non-governmental organizations...
2°
public and private universities...
3°
public institutions;
```

✓ **Article Headings:** Preserved on separate lines
```
Article 5: Origin of Commissioners
Article 18 of Law n° 19/2013...
```

✓ **Paragraphs:** Line breaks within paragraphs preserved as in PDF

✓ **Language Separation:** Each language in its own file, correctly detected

✓ **No Duplicates:** No files with suffixes (_2, _3, etc.)

## Benefits

1. **Exact Layout Match:** Output matches the PDF layout line-by-line
2. **Human Readable:** Preserves the formatting intended by document creators
3. **No Information Loss:** Every line break and spacing is kept
4. **Clean Separation:** Languages properly separated without mixing
5. **No Duplicate Files:** Each PDF produces exactly 3 files

## Technical Notes

- PyMuPDF's `get_text("dict")` mode provides line-level granularity
- Each "line" in the dict structure represents an actual visual line in the PDF
- Line breaks within text blocks are now preserved through the entire pipeline
- Text cleaning only removes excessive spaces, not structural line breaks
- Markdown formatting is minimal (only metadata header)

## Testing

All changes tested with:
- Multi-column parallel translation PDFs
- Legal documents with complex formatting
- Documents with numbered lists, articles, and sections
- Kinyarwanda, English, and French languages

## Conclusion

The LinguaSplit application now successfully preserves the original PDF layout exactly as created by humans for humans, making the output easy to read while maintaining proper language separation.
